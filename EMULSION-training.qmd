### 🎯 Learning Objectives
* **Conceptual Mapping:** Translate biological assumptions into formal state-machine diagrams.
* **Stochastic Literacy:** Understand the role of random chance in disease dynamics.
* **Parameter Sensitivity:** Identify which biological variables impact outbreak trajectories.
* **Simulation-Based Reasoning:** Use model outputs to justify public health interventions.

In the following exercises, we will start with a simple model and see how EMULSION helps to introduce new features to make it more realistic and represent detection and control measures. 
In the meanwhile, a few side issues will be also explored to illustrate specific points in modelling.

The "evolution" of the models goes through the following diagram:

Solutions are proposed for each exercise in the `solutions` directory.

### Note the transition from Compartmental (Step 1) to Hybrid (Step 6) paradigms—this is the core strength of EMULSION.
