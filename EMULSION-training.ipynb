    "1.  **`state_machines`**: This defines the \"flowchart\" of the disease—the states (**S**, **I**, and **R**) and the logical paths between them.\n",
    "2.  **`transitions`**: These are the rules for moving between states. Look for the `rate` keyword; this is where biological transitions are calculated.\n",
    "3.  **`parameters`**: This section contains constants like `transmission_rate` and `recovery_duration`.\n",
    "4.  **`initial_conditions`**: This sets initial conditions such as \"Patient Zero\" (how many individuals start in the **I** state).\n",

    "* **Persistence:** Does the number of Susceptible individuals ever reach zero? If not, why?\n",
    "* **Consistency:** Run the next cell again. Since this model is currently deterministic, does the graph look identical every time?"
