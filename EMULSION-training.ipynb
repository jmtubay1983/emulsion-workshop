    "# ⏱️ Exercise 3: Non-Exponential Durations\n",
    "\n",
    "In most basic models, the time spent in a state (like how long an individual stays a Juvenile) follows an **exponential distribution**. This assumes a \"memoryless\" process where an individual has the same probability of leaving the state every day, regardless of how long they have already been there.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMULSION allows you to specify **non-exponential durations**. This is essential for modeling specific life stages (like a fixed pregnancy period) or diseases with a strict incubation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **How it works:** When a state has a `duration` property, individuals are \"locked\" in that state until the timer is up, unless a transition is specifically marked to allow an early **escape**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Constant Duration for Juveniles\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now modify [exercises/step3.yaml](exercises/step3.yaml) to make the juvenile stage a fixed length of time ($1/maturation$) instead of a random average.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛠️ Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Rename the Model:** Open [exercises/step3.yaml](exercises/step3.yaml) and rename the model as `stoch_compart_SIR_JA_dur`.\n",
    "2.  **Define the Duration in State J:** In the `age_group` state machine, add the `duration` property to state **J**. \n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    - J:\n",
    "        name: 'Juveniles'\n",
    "        duration: 'dur_juvenile'\n",
    "        fillcolor: 'purple'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Update the Maturation Transition:** Change the transition from **J to A**. Since the duration is now handled by the state \"timer,\" replace `rate: maturation` with `proba: 1`. This tells the engine to move 100% of individuals to the Adult state as soon as the duration ends.\n",
    "4.  **Enable the Escape Condition:** We don't want juveniles to be \"immortal\" while they wait to grow up! Mark the transition from **J to D** (mortality) with `escape: yes`. \n",
    "5.  **Add the Parameter:** In the `parameters` section, define `dur_juvenile` with the value `1/maturation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why use `escape: yes`?\n",
    "Without this property, the `duration` acts like a protective shield. Individuals would be forced to stay in state **J** for the full duration, making them accidentally immune to death until they become adults. The \"escape\" allows the mortality transition to override the maturation timer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "# 🦠 3.2 Adding Latency: Transitioning to an SEIR Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In many diseases, individuals do not become contagious immediately after being infected. There is a \"waiting period\" known as the **latent** (or exposed) period. To reflect this biological reality, we will move from a simple **SIR** model to an **SEIR** model by inserting an **Exposed (E)** state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the juvenile stage where we used a constant duration, we will model latency using a **Gamma distribution**. This creates a realistic \"narrow\" window where most individuals transition around day 6, rather than at a purely random (exponential) rate.\n",

    "### 🛠️ Implementation Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "Open [exercises/step3.yaml](exercises/step3.yaml) and apply the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Rename the Model:** Change the `model_name` to `stoch_compart_SEIR_JA_dur`.\n",
    "2.  **Add State E:** In the `health_state` machine, insert state **E** between **S** and **I**. Give it a `duration` property.\n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    states:\n",
    "      - E:\n",
    "          name: 'Exposed'\n",
    "          desc: 'Infected but not yet infectious'\n",
    "          duration: 'dur_latency'\n",
    "          fillcolor: 'orange'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Adjust Transitions:** * Change the **S → I** transition to **S → E** (this is still driven by the transmission rate).\n",
    "    * Create a new transition from **E → I** with `proba: 1` (this triggers automatically when the duration in **E** expires).\n",
    "4.  **Define Parameters:** * Add `avg_dur_latency = 6`.\n",
    "    * Define `dur_latency` using: `random_gamma(50, avg_dur_latency/50)`. \n",
    "    > **Note:** We use a shape parameter of $k=50$ to ensure the distribution is very narrow around the mean.\n",
    "5.  **Update Initial Conditions:**\n",
    "    * Create a prototype named `infected` (or modify `infectious`) so that initial cases start in state **E**.\n",
    "6.  **Update Monitoring:**\n",
    "    * Modify the `percentage_prevalence` formula to include the latent individuals:\n",
